            4.13. AIJO shall initiate a process of refund of the monies paid by the User towards purchase of a Product, if upon conducting quality checks, it is satisfied that the Product being returned entitles the User to a refund. It is further clarified that
            AJIO shall not be required to make any refund or return the Product that it deems ineligible for a refund or return based on such quality checks.


        </p>
        <p>
            4.14. It is expressly clarified that the refund entitled to by a User shall not include monies paid towards shipping charges or any other such charges applicable from time to time, except in case of a Product having a defect at the time of delivery (for
            reasons attributable to, and accepted by AJIO after due verification at its sole discretion). 4.15. AJIO shall make all reasonable attempts to keep the User apprised of the status of refund through updates shared on the User’s registered mobile

        <p>
            4.16. If the request for refund is undisputed by AJIO, the refund should reflect in the User’s bank account and/or the User’s AJIO Wallet within such reasonable time (subject to the policies of the User’s bank in case of bank account/credit card refunds)
            from the date on which AJIO initiates the refund.
        </p>
        <p>
            4.17. Refunds shall be processed by AJIO through its normal banking channels except in cases where a User had utilised his/her AJIO Wallet for purchase of Products or opted for the cash on delivery option. Where a User had utilised his/her AJIO Wallet
            for payment towards the purchased Products, AJIO shall process all refunds only into such User’s AJIO Wallet. Where a User had opted for cash on delivery option for payment towards the purchased Products, AJIO shall process all refunds into
            either the User’s AJIO Wallet or the Users’ valid bank accounts, if details of such accounts are provided by the User to AJIO at the time of refund. Further, should the User have used more than 1 (one) payment option for the purchase of Products
            on the Platforms, AJIO shall process all refunds through a Payment Option (as defined in the Fees and Payments Policy) AJIO deems fit, in its sole discretion, to process such refunds. Once the amount is refunded into a User’s AJIO Wallet,
            it cannot be further transferred to any other bank account or encashed, and would continue to remain in the User’s AJIO Wallet until exhausted for shopping on the Platforms. For the purpose of illustration, if a User purchases a Product worth
            INR 1,000 (Indian Rupees One thousand) and pays INR 500 (Indian Rupees Five hundred) for the purchase of such Product using balances in his/her AJIO Wallet, and the remaining INR 500 through his credit card, and such amount is to be refunded
            pursuant to the refund criteria set out under this Cancellation, Return and Refund Policy being met, then AJIO may choose to refund, at its sole discretion, INR 500 (Indian Rupees Five hundred) to such User’s AJIO Wallet and the remaining
            INR 500 (Indian Rupees Five hundred) to the User’s credit card source account, or both the amounts only to such User’s AJIO Wallet.
        </p>
        <p>
            4.18. Return of purchased Products are facilitated through AJIO’s reverse-logistics partners. Upon a User making a request for return of Product on the Platforms and the same being duly acknowledged by AJIO, AJIO’s reverse-logistics partners shall get
            in touch with the User in order to collect the purchased Products from the User and delivering it to AJIO. While AJIO has made reasonable endeavours to ensure delivery and pick-ups across multiple locations in India, currently, AJIO has a
            select list of areas where deliveries and collection can be undertaken by its reverse-logistics partners. In events where AJIO is unable to facilitate a pick-up of the purchased Product for return from the User, the User is required to self-ship
            the Product to AJIO’s shipping warehouse, the address for which will be intimated to the User upon the User placing such request for return.. Upon self-shipping the Product to AJIO’s warehouse, the User shall be required to scan the courier/postal
            receipt to customercare@ajio.com for AJIO’s records. The aforesaid return by self-shipping the Products is subject to the returned Products passing quality check at AJIO’s returns desk/warehouse.
        </p>
        <p>
            4.19. In the event where the User claims to have self-shipped the Product in accordance with the process set out in paragraph 4.18 above and AJIO does not receive the returned Product or the package containing such Product is empty, the User shall be
            required to submit the ‘proof of delivery’ received from the courier/postal agency to AJIO to prove his/her claim of return of Products through self-shipment to AJIO. It is specifically clarified that any refunds shall be processed by AJIO
            only upon it receiving the returned Products and concluding required quality checks or receiving the ‘proof of delivery’ from the User, as the case may be.
